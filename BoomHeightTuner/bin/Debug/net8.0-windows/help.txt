- Imperial or Metric value display 

- Spray width is the  width of the individual 
   nozzle spray pattern.

 - # Nozzles - how many Nozzles are there?

 - Ball/Hyd - If you have an electric Ball 
   Valve controlling the pressure enter 1.
   If hyd PWM enter 2. (not currently active)

 - Wheel Angle - This # will set when you 
   want individual nozzle turn compensation
   to start. It's based on your actual wheel
   angle. For example if you enter 5, when
   your steer wheel angle is >= 5 degrees
   turn compensation will start.

 - Duty Cycle Adjust - factor used to tune .

 - HZ - This will run anywhere from 1 - 30 Hz 
   (times per second). The sweet spot seems
   to be 10 to 15 Hz. 

   #####  Kick and Hold tuning  ####

 - Kick Duration in millie seconds (2-6)

 - Hold Duty cycle % (10 - 30)

 - Hold PWM Frequency (50 - 500)

 - HoldRefV (System voltage)
